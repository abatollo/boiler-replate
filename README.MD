## Included dependencies

* `typescript`

* `react`

* `react-dom`

* `react-router-dom`

* `styled-components`

* `eslint`

* `prettier`

* `webpack`

## File structure

* `src/atoms` contains small solid components that will be used in many modules

* `src/modules` contains logically separate components that will be built in screens

* `src/screens` contains separate routes (pages) of an application

* `src/layout` contains components for building a layout (like containers, sidebars, wrappers, grids etc.)
